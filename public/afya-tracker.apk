This is a placeholder file. Replace this with your actual Afya Tracker APK file.

To create the real APK:
1. Open your Flutter project (afya_tracker mobile app)
2. Run: flutter build apk --release
3. Copy the generated APK from build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
4. Replace this placeholder file with the real APK
5. Rename it to "afya-tracker.apk"

For hosting options:
- GitHub Releases: Upload APK to a release
- Firebase Hosting: Host in a storage bucket
- Any file hosting service that allows direct downloads

Update the download.html file with your actual hosting URL if needed.
